# BeSocial
Social network application for Android users.
Once registered, a user is able to participate in social events, help others and post his own help requests.
After volunteering, the user gets social points and credits.
When enough social points and credits are earned, many benefits can be redeemed from the BonusArea.
Besides the volunteering part of the application, BeSocial is a regular social media where you can post things, upload pictures, search and chat with users and so on.

Hope you enjoy our app!
